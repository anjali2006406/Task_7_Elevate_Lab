# **Student_Score_Analysis Using SQLite, Pandas, and Matplotlib**


## Project Overview

This project analyzes student performance based on their subject-wise scores using Python. 

The data is stored in an SQLite database and processed using SQL queries.  

Pandas is used for data handling, and Matplotlib is used to generate visual charts.

This task is part of Elevate Labs â€“ Task 7 and is aimed at learning basic data handling, SQL operations, and Python data visualization.

**Technologies Used**

- Python
- SQLite
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

 **Steps Performed**

1. Created a SQLite database and a table student_scores
   
2. Inserted sample student data with names, subjects, and scores
   
3. Fetched and displayed all student records
   
4. Calculated:
   
   - Total score of all students
   - Average score by subject
     
6. Visualized data using:
   - Bar Chart (average scores)
   - Pie Chart (score distribution)
   - Line Chart (score trend)
   - Box Plot (score spread)


**Final Note**

This analysis is useful for visualizing and understanding student performance trends using simple SQL and Python tools. You can easily extend it to add more subjects, students, or advanced insights like ranking, outlier detection, etc.
